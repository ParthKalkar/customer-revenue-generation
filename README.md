Predicting Customer Revenue with Deep Learning

## Description: 

This project aims to predict whether a customer will generate revenue for the company or not using deep learning techniques. The prediction model is built using a simple neural network with ReLu activation functions. 

The dataset used for this project contains customer information such as age, gender, location, and past purchase history. The dataset is preprocessed to remove any missing values and normalize the data to improve the accuracy of the prediction model.

The neural network architecture used for this project consists of an input layer, one hidden layer with ReLu activation function, and an output layer with a sigmoid activation function. The number of neurons in the input layer is determined by the number of features in the dataset, while the number of neurons in the hidden layer is chosen based on experimentation to achieve optimal performance.

The model is trained using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent algorithms. The training process involves iterating over the dataset multiple times to adjust the weights and biases of the neural network until the error rate is minimized.

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results show that the model achieves a high accuracy rate, indicating that it can effectively predict whether a customer will generate revenue for the company or not.

Overall, this project demonstrates how deep learning techniques can be used to predict customer behavior and improve business outcomes. The MIT license allows for free use and modification of the code, making it accessible to a wide range of developers and organizations.

## Technology
1. Python
2. Tensorflow

## Usage
Additionally, this project provides valuable insights into the factors that contribute to customer revenue generation. By analyzing the weights assigned to each feature in the neural network, businesses can identify which customer characteristics are most important for driving revenue.

Furthermore, the prediction model can be integrated into a larger customer relationship management system to automate decision-making processes. For example, the model can be used to prioritize sales leads or target marketing campaigns towards customers who are more likely to generate revenue.

The code for this project is well-documented and includes comments to explain each step of the process. The dataset used for training and testing the model is also included, along with instructions for preprocessing the data. 

Overall, this project serves as a valuable resource for businesses looking to leverage deep learning techniques to improve their customer revenue generation strategies.
